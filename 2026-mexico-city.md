# Top Sights

## Historical & Archaeological Sites

### Zocalo & Catedral Metropolitana
The main plaza of Mexico City and one of the largest public squares in the world. The adjacent cathedral, built over nearly 250 years, blends Baroque, Neoclassical, and Renaissance styles. Explore the interior's ornate altars and the tilting foundation that reveals the city's sinking ground.

### Palacio Nacional
The seat of the Mexican federal government, home to Diego Rivera's epic murals depicting Mexico's history from pre-Columbian times through the revolution. The Grand Staircase mural alone is worth the visit.

### Templo Mayor
The excavated ruins of the main temple of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, discovered in 1978 right in the heart of the city. The adjacent museum houses over 7,000 artifacts including the massive stone disc of the moon goddess Coyolxauhqui.

### Chapultepec Castle
The only royal castle in the Americas, perched atop Chapultepec Hill. Served as a residence for Emperor Maximilian I and later Mexican presidents. Stunning city views and a beautifully preserved interior with murals, period furniture, and the National History Museum.

## Museums & Galleries

### Museo Nacional de Antropologia
One of the world's great museums, covering Mesoamerican civilizations from the Olmec to the Aztec. The Aztec Sun Stone and the replica of Pakal's tomb from Palenque are highlights. Plan at least 3-4 hours; you could easily spend a full day.

### Palacio de Bellas Artes
An Art Nouveau/Art Deco masterpiece that serves as Mexico's premier cultural center. Houses murals by Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros. Check the schedule for ballet, opera, or concerts in the stunning main hall.

### Frida Kahlo Museum (Casa Azul)
The cobalt-blue childhood home of Frida Kahlo in Coyoacan. Displays personal artifacts, some of her works, and the studio where she painted. One of the most-visited museums in Mexico City — book tickets online well in advance.

### Museo Soumaya
Carlos Slim's free private museum in Polanco, housed in a striking aluminum-clad building designed by Fernando Romero. Over 66,000 works spanning 30 centuries, including the largest collection of Rodin sculptures outside France.

### MUAC
Museo Universitario Arte Contemporaneo, on the UNAM campus. Mexico's leading contemporary art space with ambitious rotating exhibitions. The striking building by Teodoro Gonzalez de Leon is a work of art itself.

### Museo de El Carmen
A 17th-century former Carmelite monastery in San Angel with colonial-era religious art and beautifully preserved architecture. The crypt contains a famous collection of naturally mummified bodies.

## Neighborhoods

### Roma Norte
The bohemian heart of the city. Tree-lined streets, Art Deco and Art Nouveau architecture, independent galleries, bookshops, and some of the city's best restaurants and bars. A great home base for your stay.

### Condesa
Adjacent to Roma, with a more residential, leafy feel. Avenida Amsterdam is a beautiful oval-shaped pedestrian path lined with cafes. Known for its parks (Parque Mexico, Parque Espana) and dog-friendly culture.

### Coyoacan
A charming colonial-era neighborhood in the south of the city. Cobblestone streets, colorful buildings, and a lively town square. Home to the Frida Kahlo Museum and excellent food markets. Feels like a small town within the megacity.

### San Angel
An upscale colonial neighborhood known for its Saturday art bazaar at Plaza San Jacinto, elegant restaurants, and quiet cobblestone streets. The contrast to the bustle of the city center is refreshing.

### Polanco
The upscale district north of Chapultepec Park. High-end shopping along Avenida Presidente Masaryk, fine dining, and major museums (Soumaya, Jumex). Mexico City's answer to Beverly Hills.

## Parks & Nature

### Bosque de Chapultepec
One of the largest urban parks in the Western Hemisphere at over 680 hectares. Contains museums, a zoo, a botanical garden, lakes, and Chapultepec Castle. A green escape from the city that locals flock to on weekends.

### Xochimilco
A UNESCO World Heritage Site in the south of the city, known for its network of canals and colorful trajinera boats. Hire a boat and float past floating gardens (chinampas), mariachi bands, and food vendors on the water. Best on weekends for the full atmosphere.

## Architecture & Libraries

### Biblioteca Vasconcelos
A massive, futuristic public library designed by Alberto Kalach. Nicknamed the "Megabiblioteca," its transparent walls, hanging shelving units, and a whale skeleton sculpture by Gabriel Orozco make it one of the most photogenic libraries in the world. Free entry.

### UNAM Campus
The main campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Highlights include the Central Library covered in mosaic murals by Juan O'Gorman, the volcanic rock landscape of the Espacio Escultorico, and murals by Siqueiros on the Rectory Tower.

## Entertainment & Experiences

### Lucha Libre at Arena Mexico
Mexican professional wrestling in its spiritual home. The colorful masks, acrobatic moves, crowd energy, and theatrical rivalries make this an unforgettable night out even if you're not a wrestling fan. Friday nights are the main event. Buy tickets at the arena or through a tour operator.

## Day Trips

### Teotihuacan
The massive pre-Aztec archaeological site about 50 km northeast of the city. Features the Pyramid of the Sun (third-largest pyramid in the world), the Pyramid of the Moon, and the Avenue of the Dead. Arrive early to beat the crowds and heat. About 1 hour by car; arrange private transport or take a bus from Terminal del Norte.

### Tepoztlan
A magical pueblo about 1.5 hours south of the city, nestled in dramatic volcanic cliffs. Climb the Tepozteco pyramid perched on a mountaintop for stunning valley views (about 1-2 hours up). The town itself has a lively weekend market, excellent street food (cecina, itacates, tepoznieves ice cream), and a laid-back bohemian atmosphere. Great for a Saturday or Sunday day trip.

### Grutas de Tolantongo
A stunning canyon hot springs complex about 4 hours north of the city in Hidalgo state. Thermal river pools carved into the cliffside, cave hot springs with waterfalls, and infinity-style pools overlooking the canyon. Worth an overnight stay or a very long day trip. Best visited on weekdays to avoid crowds. Bring cash — no cards accepted on-site.

### Las Grutas de Cacahuamilpa
One of the largest cave systems in the world, about 2.5 hours southwest of the city in Guerrero state. Guided tours take you through enormous caverns with dramatic stalactite and stalagmite formations. Often combined with a visit to the nearby underground river at Dos Bocas for swimming and cliff jumping.

### Grutas de la Estrella
A cave system about 2 hours south of the city near Tonatico. Features an underground boat ride through illuminated caverns with striking rock formations reflected in still water. Less touristy than Cacahuamilpa, with a more intimate experience. Nearby thermal pools at Ixtapan de la Sal make for a good combo trip.

### Val'Quirico
A Tuscan-inspired village about 2 hours east of the city in Tlaxcala. Built as a commercial and residential development, it feels like stepping into a European hill town. Cobblestone streets, craft breweries, wine bars, artisan shops, and restaurants. A fun, low-key day trip for food and shopping, especially on weekends.

### Puebla
Mexico's fourth-largest city, about 2 hours east. Famous for mole poblano, chiles en nogada, and Talavera pottery. The historic center is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with beautiful colonial architecture, the ornate Capilla del Rosario, and the Great Pyramid of Cholula (the largest pyramid by volume in the world) on the outskirts. Easily a full day trip.
